# Changelog

## 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Rebuilt the public aptitude bank around the BossXCode-only intake path: `16,873` English, Quant, and Reasoning questions across `60` subject/subtopic shards.
- Added a shared aptitude attempt/ignore gate so low-signal, duplicate, unsupported, invalid, brittle-image, synthetic, and non-aptitude rows are filtered before public artifacts are written.
- Mirrored public aptitude images into `public/images/aptitude/` and validated that public aptitude data has no remote or broken image references.
- Added the public user manual route at `/manual` and linked it from the footer.

### Removed

- Retired the legacy local aptitude PDF/OCR intake path and deleted the old PDF/OCR helper scripts.
- Removed stale one-off planning/design docs and generated review snapshots from version control.
- Made `artifacts/review/` local-only via `.gitignore` so future QA reports do not clutter GitHub.
