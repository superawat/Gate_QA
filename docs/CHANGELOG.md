# Changelog

## 2026-05-26

### Added
- Implemented the image-heavy aptitude intake pass to allow visual reasoning, Venn diagram, and mirror/series questions into the platform.
- Expanded the parser, mirroring, and validation checks in `mirror-aptitude-images.mjs` and `validate-aptitude-images.mjs` to recursively inspect `options[]` HTML as well as `questionHtml`.
- Enabled text-only filtering for forbidden string patterns to prevent false-positives on image URLs containing vendor terms.
- Added parser/classifier integration unit tests in `scrape-aptitude.test.mjs` to guard remote-image rendering structures.

### Changed
- Scaled Aptitude Bank from `16,873` to `19,105` high-quality public questions (Quant: `7,680`, English: `6,062`, Reasoning: `5,363`).
- Replaced the top quick-actions grid on the Home Page with an elegant horizontal flow, stretching the Practice card to match the Streak Banner size exactly.
- Repositioned study quotes to render inside the far-right section of the primary Practice card with left-border spacing.
- Implemented dynamic, glassmorphic dropdown tooltips pointing downwards on hover/focus over the Streak stats (Best, Aura, Freeze, Days) in `StreakBanner.jsx`.
- Styled Global Navigation Drawer with a solid theme-surface background, elevated drop shadows, right borders, and slide-in transition physics to eliminate transparent bleeding and double logo overlaps.

### Verified
- `npm run qa:validate-aptitude` (passed, `19,105` rows)
- `npm run qa:validate-aptitude-images` (passed, 100% local references)
- `npm run test:unit` (passed, `247` tests)
- `npm run build` (passed, `Exit code: 0`)

## 2026-05-25

### Changed

- Restructured navigation drawer: removed nav tiles, merged Workspace into Tools (Export PDF/CSV/JSON, Import JSON).
- Moved hamburger button from left to right side of header.

- Retired `.gateqa` file format — standard `.json` for all backups.
- Added per-tool "last used" timestamps, backup reminder card (≥7 days), and info popup.
- Added in-drawer Quick Reference glossary (Streak, Best, Aura, Freeze, Days).
- Removed User Manual link from footer (now in drawer only).

## 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Rebuilt the public aptitude bank around the AptitudeBank-only intake path: `16,873` English, Quant, and Reasoning questions across `60` subject/subtopic shards.
- Added a shared aptitude attempt/ignore gate so low-signal, duplicate, unsupported, invalid, brittle-image, synthetic, and non-aptitude rows are filtered before public artifacts are written.
- Mirrored public aptitude images into `public/images/aptitude/` and validated that public aptitude data has no remote or broken image references.
- Added the public user manual route at `/manual` and linked it from the footer.

### Removed

- Retired the legacy local aptitude PDF/OCR intake path and deleted the old PDF/OCR helper scripts.
- Removed stale one-off planning/design docs and generated review snapshots from version control.
- Made `artifacts/review/` local-only via `.gitignore` so future QA reports do not clutter GitHub.

### Verified

- `npm run qa:validate-aptitude`
- `npm run qa:verify-aptitude`
- `npm run qa:validate-aptitude-images`
- `npm run test:unit -- --testTimeout=15000` (`40` files, `233` tests)
- `npm run build`
