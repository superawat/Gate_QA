# Changelog

## 2026-05-26

### Added
- Implemented the image-heavy aptitude intake pass to allow visual reasoning, Venn diagram, and mirror/series questions into the platform.
- Expanded the parser, mirroring, and validation checks in `mirror-aptitude-images.mjs` and `validate-aptitude-images.mjs` to recursively inspect `options[]` HTML as well as `questionHtml`.
- Enabled text-only filtering for forbidden string patterns to prevent false-positives on image URLs containing vendor terms.
- Added parser/classifier integration unit tests in `scrape-aptitude.test.mjs` to guard remote-image rendering structures.
- Added a full-screen HomePage readiness overlay that keeps the dashboard hidden until window load, fonts, and paint frames are ready, then fades out smoothly.

### Changed
- Scaled Aptitude Bank from `16,873` to `19,105` high-quality public questions (Quant: `7,680`, English: `6,062`, Reasoning: `5,363`).
- Replaced the top quick-actions grid on the Home Page with an elegant horizontal flow, stretching the Practice card to match the Streak Banner size exactly.
- Repositioned study quotes to render inside the far-right section of the primary Practice card with left-border spacing.
- Styled Global Navigation Drawer with a solid theme-surface background, elevated drop shadows, right borders, and slide-in transition physics to eliminate transparent bleeding and double logo overlaps.
- Compacted the Mock Test Results and Insights Mock History overview UI with denser score/time blocks, smaller summary chips, tighter spacing, and shorter review sections.
- Implemented a mobile UI pass for the HomePage: converted the four action cards into a compact horizontal scroll-snap deck for mobile screens, retaining the grid layout on desktop.
- Enhanced the mobile Practice experience: improved header spacing, added a full-width filter trigger, horizontally scrollable chips, card-like mobile question rows, stacked pagination, and enforced global horizontal overflow locking.
- Enhanced Mock History dark mode to be fully theme-aware across timing rows, empty state, charts, attempt cards, and tooltips in `MockHistoryPanel.jsx`.
- Expanded CSV export to include GATE practice, Aptitude practice, and mock-test question history in `workspaceFile.js`.
- Added CSV test coverage for the combined export in `workspaceFile.test.js`.
- Verified clean-checkout import safety for FEAT-013 is retained and passes build and e2e suites.

### Removed
- Removed the unstable hover/focus popup tooltips from Home streak stats for Best, Aura, Freeze, and Days while keeping the stat pills visible.
- Removed direct `html2canvas` dependency from `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (now only an optional transitive dependency for jsPDF).

### Verified
- `npm run test:unit` (passed, 43 files, 250 tests)
- `npm run build` (passed, Exit code: 0)
- `npm run test:e2e` (passed, 17 tests)
- `npm run qa:a11y:axe` (passed, 3 tests)
- `npm run qa:validate-data` (passed with existing non-failing coverage warning)
- `npm run qa:validate-bundle-budget` (passed)
- `npm run qa:validate-landing-network` (passed)
- `npm run qa:validate-public-parity` (passed)
- `npm run lighthouse:mobile` (passed)
- `npm run qa:validate-aptitude` (passed, `19,105` rows)
- `npm run qa:validate-aptitude-images` (passed, 100% local references)
- `git diff --check -- src\components\Home\StreakBanner.jsx src\index.css src\components\Insights\MockHistoryPanel.jsx src\components\MockTest\MockTestResults.jsx` (passed)
- `git diff --check -- src\pages\HomePage.jsx src\index.css` (passed)
- `git diff --check` (passed with only CRLF warnings for the mobile UI pass)
- Note: Other modified files (Home/UI files, docs, generated public artifacts) remain in the worktree untouched to isolate these specific fixes.
- Full unit/build suites were not rerun for the final UI passes alone because the project instructions say to skip them unless explicitly requested.

## 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Rebuilt the public aptitude bank around the AptitudeBank-only intake path: `16,873` English, Quant, and Reasoning questions across `60` subject/subtopic shards.
- Added a shared aptitude attempt/ignore gate so low-signal, duplicate, unsupported, invalid, brittle-image, synthetic, and non-aptitude rows are filtered before public artifacts are written.
- Mirrored public aptitude images into `public/images/aptitude/` and validated that public aptitude data has no remote or broken image references.
- Added the public user manual route at `/manual` and linked it from the footer.

### Removed

- Retired the legacy local aptitude PDF/OCR intake path and deleted the old PDF/OCR helper scripts.
- Removed stale one-off planning/design docs and generated review snapshots from version control.
- Made `artifacts/review/` local-only via `.gitignore` so future QA reports do not clutter GitHub.

### Verified

- `npm run qa:validate-aptitude`
- `npm run qa:verify-aptitude`
- `npm run qa:validate-aptitude-images`
- `npm run test:unit -- --testTimeout=15000` (`40` files, `233` tests)
- `npm run build`
